About
--------

Implementations of data structures and algorithms introduced in Berkeley's [**CS 61B Data Structures**](http://datastructur.es/sp17/index.html) offered by [**Josh Hug**](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/joshhug.html). Topics covered by the course included:


- Java Introduction:
    * syntax, function, static & instance, types, testing, package
    * Interface vs Implementation Inheritance
- Linked Lists:
    * access control, nested class, recursion
    * Generics, Array, Invariants, Autoboxing
    * higher order function, polymorphism, comparable
- Map (Hash Table):
    * Exception, Iterator/Iterable, Encapsulation
    * ADT implementation: Extension, Delegation, Adaptation
    * External chaining, Open addressing (linear probing)
- Asymptotics:
    * time & space complexity (Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega)
    * Amortized analysis (potential, empirical)
- Disjoint Sets: quick find, weighted quick union, path compression
- Tree: binary search tree, B-Tree (2-3, 2-3-4), Red-Black Tree, Tries
- Priority Queue: Heap, heapification
- Sorting:
    * selection sort, mergesort, quicksort, heapsort
    * insertion sort, Shell's sort, counting sort, MSD Radix Sort
- Graph:
    * DFS, BFS, topological sort
    * Shortest path: Dijkstra's, A*
    * Minimum spanning tree (MST): Prim's, Kruskal's
- Complexity: P, NP, NP-complete
